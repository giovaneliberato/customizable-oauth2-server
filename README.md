# OAuth2 server - Ready for customization!

This web service implements a **fully-compliant OAuth2 server** following the [RFC-6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749). It is framework and infrastructure agnostic. 

If you need to provide OAuth2 authentication but already have your authentication systems in place, this is the project you have been looking for!



**This project implements everything** related to client managent, request validation, redirects and errors and **you are only required to integrate a couple of layers** to make it ready to production!
